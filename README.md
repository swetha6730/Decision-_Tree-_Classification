#PROJECT TITLE:predection of iris.csv dataset for decesion tree alogrithm using supervised learning machine alogrithm
#PROBLEM STATEMENT:A American based botinical garden a grow ice flower in their labsbut using bio technology in a single treedifferent type of verity flower is grow.as a datascience engineer find out how much accuracy is thereall categories contains same species
#import libraries
# Load the Iris dataset
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
# Create a Decision Tree classifier
# Train the classifier on the training data
